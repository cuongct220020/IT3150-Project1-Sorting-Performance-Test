**Program Description**<br>
This program is designed to test and compare the execution times of three sorting algorithms: 
Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort. It allows users to measure the performance of individual 
sorting algorithms or compare all three simultaneously, using large datasets.

**Features**<br>
**1. Measure Execution Time of a Single Algorithm**<br>
   1.1 Import a .txt file containing more than 10,000 elements.<br>
   1.2 Specify the number of elements to sort.<br>
   1.3 Select one of three sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Quick Sort).<br>
   1.4 Display the execution time of the chosen algorithm and save the results to a specified output file.<br>

**2. Compare Execution Times of All Three Algorithms**<br>
   2.1 Select a pre-defined dataset size: 10,000, 100,000, or 1,000,000 elements.<br>
   2.2 Automatically load the corresponding input file.<br>
   2.3 Measure and display the execution times of all three algorithms.<br>
   2.4 Verify the accuracy of the sorted results and save them to an output file if all algorithms produce identical outputs.<br>

**3. Exit Program**<br>
   The program allows users to exit gracefully at any point.
